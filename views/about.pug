          p I'm a web developer based in Los Angeles. After working for several years as composer's assistant to David Kitay (Clueless, Ghost World, Look Who's Talking), I decided to make a career transition and began building skills in front end development. I'm currently finishing up the Front End TechDegree at Team Treehouse.
