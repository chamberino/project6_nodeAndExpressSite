Portfolio Site Using Node.js and Express

This site uses pug to build the HTML templates.

The majority of the content is generated by accessing the values of projects object in data.json.
The object contains 6 projects and relevant information that can be iterated over and injected into the templates.

Review Note: To customize my project I added the following...
  -CSS transitions to an overlay on the home page that slides over the project revealing a button.
  -Font to PT Sans
  -Box shadows to the projects on the home page
